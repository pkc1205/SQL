To display cumulative percent to total in SQL, we use the same idea as we saw in the Percent To Total section. The difference is that we want the cumulative percent to total, not the percentage contribution of each individual row. Let's use the following example to illuatrate:

Table Total_Sales
Name	Sales
John	10
Jennifer	15
Stella	20
Sophia	40
Greg	50
Jeff	20
SELECT a1.Name, a1.Sales, SUM(a2.Sales)/(SELECT SUM(Sales) FROM Total_Sales) Pct_To_Total 
FROM Total_Sales a1, Total_Sales a2 
WHERE a1.Sales <= a2.sales or (a1.Sales=a2.Sales and a1.Name = a2.Name) 
GROUP BY a1.Name, a1.Sales 
ORDER BY a1.Sales DESC, a1.Name DESC;


Result:

Name	Sales	Pct_To_Total
Greg	50	0.3226
Sophia	40	0.5806
Stella	20	0.7097
Jeff	20	0.8387
Jennifer	15	0.9355
John	10	1.0000
