Table Total_Sales
Name	Sales
John	10
Jennifer	15
Stella	20
Sophia	40
Greg	50
Jeff	20
we would type,

SELECT Sales Median FROM 
(SELECT a1.Name, a1.Sales, COUNT(a1.Sales) Rank 
FROM Total_Sales a1, Total_Sales a2 
WHERE a1.Sales < a2.Sales OR (a1.Sales=a2.Sales AND a1.Name <= a2.Name) 
group by a1.Name, a1.Sales 
order by a1.Sales desc) a3 
WHERE Rank = (SELECT (COUNT(*)+1) DIV 2 FROM Total_Sales);
Result:

Median
20
